# MIDIcontroller v2.5.3
### A library for creating Teensy MIDI controllers.
###### by Josh Nishikawa <github.com/joshnishikawa/MIDIcontroller>

 FEATURES INCLUDE:
  - velocity sensitive FSR, Piezo or Capacitive Touch inputs
  - momentary, latch or 'trigger' type MIDI buttons (also work with Cap Touch) 
  - stable analog to MIDI conversion for potentiometers and other sensors
  - stable Capacitive Touch to MIDI conversion for expression control
  - support for encoders
  - Min/Max output can be set (or inverted) for all MIDI. Min/Max input
      can also be set for analog input (maintaining stability in conversion)

***THIS LIBRARY REQUIRES - MIDI Library, Bounce, Encoder, Flicker***

### VERSION LOG:
v2.5.3
- 'MIDIswitch' now preferred over 'MIDIbutton' ( 'MIDIbutton' still works ).
- Added a send(FORCE) function to allow event-based sending of current CC value.
    This works for MIDIswitch, MIDIpot, MIDIenc and MIDItouch. This allows
    'bulk send' to be implemented. WARNING! In the main loop, just use send()

- MIDIswitch default of MOMENTARY works now. use MIDIswitch(pin, CC)

v2.4.3
- Fixed the PER_DETENT bug (again).
- Made PER_DETENT the default since it works cleaner and is probably more useful
- Added a write(int) function to the MIDIenc class that will set it to a
    specific value and immediately send a MIDI message for that CC at that value

2.4.2 
- Fixed a bug preventing PER_DETENT from working on encoders.

2.4.1 
- Bounce (not Bounce2) is listed as a dependency.

2.4.0
- The .4. is for the added inputRange() and setWaitTime() functions
- This update also (actually) fixes that MIDIdrum bug preventing high velocity

2.3.4 
- Added inputRange() to MIDIdrum.
- Added an example for muxed input.
- Fixed a bug preventing MIDIdrum from sending velocity 127.

2.3.3 
- Made waitTime for MIDIdrum user-selectable.

2.3.2 
- Fixed the broken smooth() function for analog inputs.

2.3.1 
- All examples updated to prevent MIDI and usbMIDI stack crashes.

2.3.0 
- A major update to the Flicker library:
    - thresholds for Capacitive Touch buttons are automatically detected 
    - more stable expression control for MIDItouch(previously MIDIcapSens)
    - MIDIdrum includes option to use velocity-sensitive Capacitive Touch
- Even better stabilization of analog inputs
- Added option for encoders to change 1 CC value per detent
- Made "killSwitch" user-selectable (just put any CC# instead of KILL)
- Added setKillSwitch(byte) to set kill CC (use OFF or 0 to disable it).
- Added a few visual aides

2.2.5 
- Bugfixed jitter that occurred when using inputRange() with input maxed
- Arguments for specific velocities can now be passed to velocity inputs
- Added literals to highlight MOMENTARY, LATCH, TRIGGER and KILL modes
- Long overdue completion of the "Flicker" library (for Cap Touch input)
- Made separate examples for 'pot' and 'sensor' (to avoid confusion)

2.2.0 
- Added support for Piezos (Must be wired properly. See example)
- "MIDInote" class changed to "MIDIdrum" and optimized for FSR and Piezo
- Removed redundant 'velocity' variable. Just call outputRange(127, 127)
- Added support for using a Capacitive Touch input as a MIDIbutton
- Included 'Flicker' library (required for Capacitive Touch buttons)

2.1.5 
- got rid of useless '*MC' pointer. renamed 'kill' to 'mode'

2.1.3 
- included an example of how to implement aftertouch

2.1.2 
- many variables changed to 'byte' or 'uint16_t' for easy storage
- public and private variables are better sorted

2.1.0 
- Split read() and send() functions. MIDI channel is now user selectable

2.0.6 
- Fixed a bug preventing poly CC to return to zero after note off.

2.0.5 
- Added a condition to prevent many double note triggers.

2.0.4 
- Added support for capacitive sensors (and started this version log)
